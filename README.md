# Paint

A **Paint** application, inspired by MS Paint that lets you express the artist in you! You can change foreground and background colors, set stroke width of your paint brush, erase your strokes, clear the canvas and also save your artwork as a JPEG file. You can also save your unfinished painting in local storage, and retrive it at any later point in time. You can also clear the local storage whenever you wish to.
